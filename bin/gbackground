# Set your background wallpaper in Gnome 3
#
# Takes one argument. If that argument is a file then presumes the file is an
# image and uses that file as the background. If the first argument is a
# directory then it uses a random file from that directory. If the argument
# starts with "http" it will treat it as a url and try to fetch an image.
# You can also set a default directory to use when no args are given (see below).
#
# It will also try to guess whether to use "zoom" or "spanned" or "tiled" mode
# for the background. If you have multiple monitors and the the image is wide enough
# it will use "spanned" mode. Disable that by using nospan as the second param.
# If the image is small it will tile it.
#
# Requires identify from ImageMagick. You can get this using:
#  $ sudo yum install ImageMagick
#
# Example usage:
#  $ gbackground
#  $ gbackground new
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/octocat.jpg
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/octocat.jpg nospan
#  $ gbackground http://assets.warpspire.com/images/github/octocat.png
