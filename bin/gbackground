# Set your background wallpaper in Gnome 3

# Takes one argument. If that argument is a file then presumes the file is an
# image and uses that file as the background. If the first argument is a
# directory then it uses a random file from that directory.
#
# It will also try to guess whether to use "zoom" or "spanned" mode for the
# background. If you have multiple monitors and the the image is wide enough
# it will use "spanned" mode. Disable that by using nospan as the second param.
#
# Requires identify from ImageMagick. You can get this using:
#  $ sudo yum install ImageMagick
#
# Example usage:
#  $ gbackground
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/octocat.jpg
#  $ gbackground ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/octocat.jpg nospan
